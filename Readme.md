## Satellite male distribution across heterogenous landscapes

### Purpose

In many animal systems, dominant males defend territories, while satellite males are pushed into lower-quality habitats.

Where exactly do these satellite males move to? Do they settle randomly in the landscape, or do they find the next most available spot?

I'm attempting to simulate potential dispersal behaviors of satellite males, to see what matches some empirical data best.

### Model

This will be an individual-based model, coded in the NetLogo language.

### Current thoughts

* Satellite males could turn out to be super ephemeral, distributional patterns fleeting and difficult to capture.
* So how to capture? Pseudo-equilibrium of occupancy in each patch?

Very much a work in progress! This Readme may not reflect the most current version of the model.
